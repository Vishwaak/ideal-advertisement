# üéØ Contextual Ad Matching System

## Overview
The **Contextual Ad Matching System** intelligently matches advertisements to specific moments within a video based on **emotional tone**, **persona alignment**, and **content relevance**.  
It integrates emotion analysis, persona-based ad scoring, and timestamp optimization to automatically generate a **timestamped ad placement plan** that explains **which ads to show, when, and why**.

## üß© System Architecture

### **Input**
- **Main Video** ‚Äî Primary video content where ads will be inserted.  
- **N Ad Videos** ‚Äî Pool of potential advertisements.  
- **Persona Config** ‚Äî Set of persona definitions and preferences used for persona-based analysis.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è MODULE A: Ad Selection

### 1. Persona Analysis
- Analyzes each ad video from multiple persona perspectives.
- Generates individual **scores per persona** based on appeal and relevance.

### 2. Similarity Analysis
- Evaluates **content relevance** between ad and main video.
- Measures **audience alignment** to ensure targeted delivery.

### 3. Composite Scoring
- Combines multiple metrics into a unified ranking score.
- Produces a **Ranked Ad List** based on best fit for the given context.

---

## üé¨ MODULE B: Ad Placement

### 1. Emotion Timeline Analysis
- Extracts emotion timestamps from the main video.  
- Analyzes emotional content frame-by-frame.  
- Generates **emotion scores (0‚Äì10)** representing emotional intensity.  

üîó **External APIs:**
- **Video Analysis API** ‚Äì for visual and emotional content extraction.  
- **Gemini API** ‚Äì for semantic emotion interpretation and contextual embedding.

### 2. Ad Opportunity Detection
- Identifies **peak emotional moments** ideal for ad insertion.  
- Matches **ad types** to emotional categories.  
- Generates placement suggestions.

**Output:**  
- Emotion Timeline (CSV + Graph)

---

## üîÑ Integration

Combines outputs from **Module A** and **Module B**:

- Selects **best-matching ads** (from Module A)
- Pairs with **optimal emotional timestamps** (from Module B)
- Generates a **placement strategy** that balances relevance, timing, and emotional continuity.

## ‚úÖ Final Output

**Timestamped Ad Placement Plan**
- Which ads to show  
- When to show them  
- Why they match (based on persona, emotion, and context)
